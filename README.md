# R Code - Wrangle Floodzone Data

## Source: NYU Furman Center 
### Link: http://floodzonedata.us/

Furman provides housing and floodplain data sourced from the National Housing Preservation Database, U.S. Census Bureau, and the  National Flood Hazard Layer data from the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). Methodology can be found here: https://furmancenter.org/floodzonedata/data/methodology

This repository focuses on housing in New York, overall, and demonstrates how to wrangle the data from wide to long. Because the column names vary by length, it is recommended to initially create subsets by subject (e.g., population, race and ethnicity, building type, tenure, etc.).
